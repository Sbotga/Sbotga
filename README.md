### WHERE IS requirements.txt?
This repository hides the requirements.txt, as well as all PJSK API-based code. This will not be made publicly available, due to the sensitive nature of the game's API.

# To use chart generation
You need to install geckodriver (just install firefox on Windows, on Ubuntu follow other instructions) (complicated...)
