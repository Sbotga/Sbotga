### API-based code
This repository hides all PJSK API-based code. This will not be made publicly available, due to the sensitive nature of the game's API.

I recommend looking at mos' sssekai library if you want to start.

# To Use Grouped Commands (twitch version of Sbotga)
You need to add group to `__all__` in `ext/commands/core.py` of twitchio

# To use chart generation
You need to install geckodriver (just install firefox on Windows, on Ubuntu follow other instructions) (complicated...)

# mitmproxy
Install mitmproxy

on ubuntu: `sudo apt install mitmproxy`
