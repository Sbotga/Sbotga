        "(I didn't manage to talk with her yet again... When did I start becoming so awkward around Honami and Shiho? And Saki is...)",
        "Is this how it's all going to end? We'll just graduate and split up without ever speaking to each other again?",
        "Miku's amazing... She's always so free and versatile. She can do anything. Unlike me...",
        "My guitar case is so dusty...\n\n(But I guess I won't ever be playing it again... We promised each other we'd form a band and be together forever, but now...)",
        "My friends... You don't mean... But...we've all... And Saki, she's...",
        "Another shooting star! Well, might as well make a wish! I wish that the four of us will be able to see a beautiful meteor shower together again...",
        "(She's amazing. She can sing any song, in any style. She can do anything. Unlike me...)",
        "Ichika's Classmate: That Hinomori's got attitude. She's cool, but also kind of scary, don't you think?\n\nIchika: She's not really anything like that though...",
        "(They didn't want to talk to me. Again. I guess they don't consider me a friend anymore.)",
        "(I should explain the situation to her... On the other hand, Saki being back might change things between Honami, Shiho, and me...)",
        "She gets hostile when anyone tries to make friends with her.",
        "Back when everyone was talking about how awesome bubble tea was, I was subsisting on bland hospital food...",
        "Ahaha... It feels a bit lonely. Just the two of us.",
        "Why are they both being like that? It's like they're avoiding me.",
        "Ichi... Did something happen when I was in hospital?",
        "(Saki noticed that something's not right, but she's not asking about it because she doesn't want to upset me. I feel so bad for her. She hasn't done anything wrong.)",
        "Stop. Ichika, Saki, you're falling behind. Follow Honami's beat. This is precisely why I didn't want to do this.",
        "(Shiho and Honami both remembered how to play this song. Could it be they too hoped that one day, we'd... Maybe that's just wishful thinking.)",
        "Oh... Looks like we're not all friends anymore..",
        "Are you giving up? Are you sure they don't want to be friends?",
        "I don't want to be in a band with you. Period.",
        "I'm sorry but I don't think I want to do this either.",
        "(I knew it seemed too easy...)",
        "I've had enough. Tell me how to get out of here.",
        "(Maybe if we got the band back together, like Saki said...)\n\nThings between us could go back to how they used to be...",
        "Honami's Classmate B: Yikes, Hinomori's glaring at us. Did she say something mean to you, Honami? Are you okay?\n\nHonami: I'm fine... It wasn't anything like that...\n\nHonami's Classmate A: She's really scary. Definitely in the no-friends zone.",
        "Honami's Classmate B: Yeah. Did you hear that she hangs out at some sketchy dive?\n\nHonami: I don't think that's true. She just has a part-time job at a live house.",
        "(Shiho isn't that kind of person...)",
        "Hehe. I'm just passing by on my way to see a friend. Hold on... Is something wrong? You're even more sullen than usual.",
        "I'm fine. I told you not to talk to me at school, didn't I?",
        "Shii... You don't look okay to me...",
        "We've been friends with the other two girls since we were little. We used to be really close, hanging out together every day. But then I had to stay in the hospital for a long time, and when I came back, Shiho and Hona didn't want to speak with me.",
        "Some things might be hard to say to someone you care about.",
        "(Saki is really enjoying this. But I bed she would be having even more fun if Honami and Shiho were with us too.)",
        "(Saki makes everything fun, like back in the old days. But I keep thinking that I should tell her what happened when she was away. I just don't know how.)",
        "Shiho: Don't talk to me anymore.\n\nIchika: M-Me?\n\n Shiho: I want to eat lunch quickly so I can practice bass. Don't come over anymore.\n\nIchika: B-But... Shiho...",
        "(All of a sudden, Shiho didn't want to hang out with us. She grew more and more distant. When I asked her why, she replied that she wanted to be left alone and that was it.)",
        "How much longer do I have to keep this up? ...I can't see any stars tonight.\n\n(Maybe it's because everyone's not with me).",
        "(Why is Honami eating her lunch all alone? She normally eats with her friends.)",
        "Ex-Classmate A: Hey, want to go to karaoke after school today? Everyone else is coming.\n\nEx-Classmate B: Everyone else...but not HER, right?\n\nEx-Classmate A: Of course not. She's no fun to have around.",
        "I came to ask if I could borrow your math textbook... But more importantly, are you okay? Did something happen with your friends?",
        "But... Is it really so wrong to care about others?",
        "(After that, whenever I asked her if she was okay, she'd find some excuse to slip away. I had my suspicions...).",
        "If I'd only done something then, maybe things wouldn't have turned out the way they did...",
        "Saki: You're making it sound like I was really pushy...\n\nShiho: You were, and you still are. Just like my sister. In the end, I had no choice but to give in.\n\nSaki: Sorry... ",
        "I joined a band once, in junior high. An older member from the school pop music club invited me. It turned out the other members treated it more like a social club. They couldn't even play a single song half-decently. We got into an argument... And in the end, they kicked me out.",
        "They want me to play with them... I thought it was best if I just kept my distance...",
        "Huh? Was that a shooting star? Oh... It was just a plane. I guess there's no way you could see a shooting star from here.",
        "(I'm happy for them, if they really made up. It's nice that they can be friends again. It's for the best... But why did seeing them together make me feel so lonely?)",
        "(I haven't missed a single note! I just have to keep it up and Shiho will agree to join our band! Uh... Why am I...getting dizzy? Not now... We're so close. I have to finish the song...)",
        "Hehe... Sorry I didn't say anything... I think I've worked up a fever...",
        "Despite practicing with you every day, I didn't notice you were sick. I'm sorry.",
        "It's my fault for making you overwork yourself.",
        "No, it's nobody's fault but mine for not realizing my limits. I was having so much fun today that I just didn't want to stop even when I knew I should've.",
        "Ichika: I thought you hated me, Shiho. I didn't think we'd get to hang out like this ever again.\n\nShiho: No, I never hated you...",
        "Tell me, Shiho... What happened while I was in the hospital?",
        "But you know I'm not the social type. I don't feel the need to be around other people. So I kept refusing. Because of that, my classmates started to avoid me. I had no problem with that. I was glad not to be bothered. But then...",
        "Shiho's Classmate A: She seemed rude and a bit stand-offish too.\n\nShiho's Classmate B: I can't stand people who think they're too cool for everyone else. Like, they're too special to be friends with you.",
        "I snapped at them for saying bad things about my friends behind their backs, but that only made things worse. Personally, I don't care what they say about me. But I didn't want them to start spreading malicious rumors about Ichika or Honami.",
        "If I really cared about protecting you, I shouldn't have agreed to this session. So much for self-control. Well, I warned you, at least. So if you want to keep this going, don't come crying to me later saying you can't hack it.",
        "( I haven't seen Saki around in a while. I wonder if something happened. Could she have had a relapse?)",
        "Sorry. I'm one to talk... I wasn't there for you when you were going through a rough time, so I can't expect you to want to be friends with me now.",
        "Ex-Classmate C: Honami, you got a moment? I need to talk to you.\n\nHonami: Yes, sure. What do you want to talk about?\n\nEx-Classmate C: I heard you were talking crap about me after class yesterday.\n\nHonami: What? I'd never...",
        "Ex-Classmate C: Two girls from my school club were kicking up a fuss over what I said to them. You agreed with them, no? Whose side are you on?\n\nHonami: I... I wasn't taking sides...",
        "Ex-Classmate C: I heard that you always tell people what they want to hear. Some people-pleaser you are.\n\nHonami: That's not what I was... It's just that... It's hard to not have anyone to talk to when you're hurt. I thought it would help them...",
        "Ex-Classmate C: A friend to everybody is a friend to nobody. You thought you could make everybody like you by nodding and smiling at anything they say, huh?",
        "Ex-Classmate B:I saw Honami chatting to some friend in the hallway. I swear she was complaining we're bullying her here.\n\nEx-Classmate C: Pfft! I gave her a piece of my mind for being such a bootlicker and now she's acting all hurt.",
        "Ex-Classmate C: She just wants to play the victim. That friend of hers is just the same, taking her side without even bothering to find out what happened.\n\nEx-Classmate A: I see Honami talking to that girl all the time. Her name's Hoshino.",
        "I'm sorry, Ichika... Please don't talk to me at school anymore.",
        "But... I'm scared, you know? I don't want my classmates to whisper things behind my back, or laugh at me, or ignore me. It felt so awful, and I don't want to go through that ever again!",
        "I don't want them to call me a bootlicker, or a people-pleaser who's friends with everybody, and friends with nobody. So... I decided to prove my loyalty to them by not having friends outside our class.",
        "You can't be serious! What they said to you was just nasty! You're kind to everyone and there's nothing wrong with that. I know you, Honami, they don't!",
        "I... don't even know what friendship is anymore.",
        "She looked really sad, so I wanted to find out why, but she always just clammed up. Didn't you notice how she was depressed all the time?",
        "Shiho: Anyway, seems she couldn't stand being excluded, so now she follows her classmates around like a dog.\n\nIchika: Shiho, you're being mean.",
        "It peeves me that she changed so much. She used to be kind to everyone, but assertive. When someone was being mean, she'd call them out on it. But now? It's like she doesn't have a mind of her own anymore. If her classmates told her to bark and roll over, she would. It makes me so mad to see her like that.",
        "What she's doing is turning her back on us and her other friends because she can't face up to those bullies. That's not a solution!",
        "You have to understand that she's scared. Besides, she's the gentle type. She worries about upsetting people around her.",
        "Yeah, right. But she didn't care about upsetting you or Saki?! ...Look, I'm sorry. I just can't understand why Honami's being like this. Although I guess I can't really talk...",
        "I see now what we should do. We should give up on getting her to join the band.",
        "Yeah. This will be an act of kindness from me to her. Heh, I guess I kinda sound full of myself. But I don't want to cause her any more trouble. I wish I could tell her that I'll always be her friend, no matter what... But I wasn't there for her when she needed me before, so it would just sound like an empty promise.",
        "I'm sorry... I told you about the bullying because I thought we could still do something now. I didn't mean to make you feel bad about what happened...",
        "Anyway, Hona is now getting along with her classmates. I don't think it would be right for us to throw a spanner in the works because we think our friendship should matter more to her. We have to respect her choices.",
        "I have a friend who's really important to me, and I want to respect her choices, but by doing that, I also feel like I'm failing her... I have no idea what to do.",
        "I'm sorry for being so insistent, asking you to join our band again and again. I really wanted to find something that would bring the four of us together again, you know. But I didn't realize how selfish I was being. I didn't consider it from your point of view. I'm really sorry.",
        "Ichi told me everything. About what you went through in junior high school. If something like that happened to me, I don't know how I'd have coped. It must have been so awful for you. That's why I don't want to get between you and the friends you have now.",
        "Yeah! I told her everything... Oh... Sorry... I don't know why I'm crying... Haha... The tears just won't stop for some reason...",
        "Saki hasn't been herself ever since she spoke to Honami.",
        "Ichika: Do you think it really was for the best?\n\nShiho: You kidding? Nothing's ever felt more wrong.",
        "Are you going to keep evading me forever?",
        "I heard about your classmate troubles. You've been acting weird ever since.",
        "You'll probably think I'm full of crap for saying this to you after I tried to cut ties with everyone earlier... But I'm going to say it anyway. Are you sure this is what you want? Saki told you she's given up, but you're not dumb, so you must know that's not true. Don't you care about Saki's feelings?",
        "Saki wants what's best for you. She's forcing herself to abandon your friendship because she thinks that will make you happy. Who are you doing all this for?",
        "You're only thinking about protecting your own feelings. You're so scared someone will hurt you that you prefer to run away when things get difficult.",
        "You don't know? Really? You made Saki cry, you realize that, don't you?!",
        "What? I...I don't want to make her sad! But... I don't want to be bullied again!",
        "So it's clear, you don't give a damn about us.",
        "One last thing. You probably see this without me pointing it out but... You're making it pretty obvious you think your current friends would turn on you given half a chance.",
        "(I get it. Really, I do. I know Honami didn't come to us for help because she didn't want us to worry. Then why...)\n\nWhy can I only say such hurtful things to her?",
        "I talked to Honami. But...I messed up. I said some really mean things to her. Why am I so useless with things like this? I'm really hating myself right now. I can't even articulate why I went to talk to her in the first place. I'm such an idiot.",
        "Ichika: You know, that's something I really admire about you.\n\nShiho: What? Acting without thinking?\n\nIchika: No, your determination. Once you make up your mind about something, you act. I think that's impressive. I could never be like that.",
        "(I guess I was different in the past. I used to be more proactive when it came to our group. My friends matter to me just as much now, and I want to do everything I can to bring us all back together, but... I feel powerless.)\n\nWhat can I do?",
        "Saki gave up on asking Honami to join us, because she thinks Honami is happier with her current group of friends. Shiho couldn't bear how sad that made Saki, though, and she went to talk to Honami and ask if that's what she really wanted. As for me... I haven't done anything.",
        " I also want us all to be back together, but I feel like my hands are tied. And back when Honami was being bullied, I did nothing. I knew I should have, but when she told me not to worry, I just didn't know what to do...",
        "For a long time now, I've just been sitting on my hands, instead of helping my friends.",
        "Ex-Classmate A: Honami's such a bootlicker.\n\nEx-Classmate B: Yeah. She thinks that's how she'll get everyone to like her.\n\nEx-Classmate C: But I bet she believes she's such an angel. We can all see through her phoney kindness.",
        "I'm pathetic... It's like Shiho said. I feel sorry for myself... That's why I gave in to the pressure from my classmates. I didn't want to be disliked. It made me so scared... But I only ended up hurting those who cared about me the most.",
        "Saki... Shiho... Please forgive me! When my classmates started ignoring me, I was terrified. But I couldn't bring myself to tell you what was going on.",
        "I was so afraid it would happen again in high school, so I did everything I could not to upset the few people in my class who were nice to me. I acted as if you weren't my friends any more, even though that hurt you...",
        "I should apologize for not having been able to help you. I wasn't there for you when you were having a really difficult time.",
        "I also shouldn't have left you alone for so long. I noticed that something was wrong, but did nothing.",
        "How can you still care about me after I shunned everyone and hurt your feelings...",
        "Shiho... No, you were right. You opened my eyes to what I was doing to all of you. If you hadn't gotten so angry with me, I'd have just carried on, telling myself everything was all right. Thank you, Shiho.",
        "(If I'd only known it would be this easy. I should have been honest with my friends. It was so silly of me to think they wouldn't understand.)",
        "I was born with bad luck.",
        "No matter how hard I tried, so many things would still go wrong. And I just got sick of it...",
        "(I'm totally playing hooky today. I know it's not good to, but I just don't feel like going... Everyone's probably still angry at me for dropping the baton during that race... It's always like this... I do everything I can, but things just never go well.)\n\nIf things are always going to end badly, maybe I should just stop trying...",
        "(Would I be able to sing and dance like that too if I practiced real hard?)\n\nBut...even if I try, it'll just end up being...",
        "Tomorrow will always be a better day... Is that true? If I keep trying, will my better tomorrow come one day too?",
        "Still no notification... I wonder if I've failed another audition...",
        "(This makes fifty rejections. I thought I had a shot after I passed their first round of applications, too.)",
        "ASRUN is disbanding...and Haruka Kiritani is retiring.\n\n(But Haruka is the only reason I've been able to keep trying all this time. Why now?!)\n\nI don't know what to think anymore...",
        "(She...looks kind of exhausted... I can't blame her. It must have been a rough day with everyone constantly hitting her with questions.)",
        "Just tell it to me straight! I'm not letting you leave until you talk to me! Now hurry up, will you?!",
        "Shizuku, I heard something from an old friend of mine. There's a rumor that you haven't been getting along with your group and are thinking of transferring.",
        "Spit it out already! Being indecisive is the worst thing in our line of work! The fans pick up on it and start to get worried!",
        "Y-You big shot idols always act so high and mighty! This is exactly why I hate dealing with them! ...Whatever! As long as you keep this to yourself! Don't you go blabbing to all your friends, either!",
        "...Whatever! As long as you keep this to yourself! Don't you go blabbing to all your friends, either!",
        "You'd be better off giving up now. You don't seem like the idol type.",
        "Airi, stop... You shouldn't just deny someone's dreams like that. You may no longer be actively working, but you're still an idol who's meant to give everyone hope. I don't like it when you say things like that, Airi.",
        "I've always been very unlucky.",
        "Whenever I participate in field trips, it always rains. Even if you make a Teru Teru Bozu, it's no good...",
        "Even if I try my best, there are lots of things that cannot be helped, and I started to get a little sick of it...",
        "I've taken a break from school. That's not good...but I really don't want to go.",
        "I'm sure everyone is upset because I dropped the baton...",
        "Even if I do my best… I think it's useless… I wonder if there's only bad things...",
        "I wonder if that's true. If I do my best without giving up, someday... I wonder if a good day will come...",
        "Yes. I've already decided. I'm quitting as an idol.",
        "The mail has not yet arrived... I knew it, it was probably a mistake to do this audition...",
        "(... I was able to work so hard because Haruka-chan was there, but... Now...)",
        "My feelings are all mixed up, I don't understand anything...",
        "(Now that I have seen Haruka-chan here, that is when I have realized that she has really quit...)",
        "(Haruka-chan is an idol, but she is also a normal girl...)",
        "Hey, Haruka-chan Why did you retire? I couldn't hear you say it, was because something unpleasant happened?",
        "(Oh, right. It must have been difficult to be surrounded by everyone and to be asked many questions...)",
        "I told you to be more serious!",
        "Did you hear me? You're not going home until we talk! Come on, talk already!",
        "...Shizuku. I heard this from a junior. There are several rumours that you don't get along with the members of your unit and they say you are going to transfer.",
        "You have to be clearer about what you want! That passive attitude is not good! If you keep this up, you'll end up making the fans worry!",
        "Eavesdropping? Weren't you the one who started shouting, thinking that no one was here?",
        "You will try harder? Just because you try harder doesn't mean you'll get what you want!",
        "You don't seem to be suitable for that... You shouldn't try to be an idol.",
        "You shouldn't deny that girl her dream.",
        "...Airi-chan you are not working now but, an idol has to give hope to others. So... Airi-chan, I wish you wouldn't say something like that again.",
        "I've already told you that just making an effort won't get you what you want!",
        "... Again, only Shizuku is going to be on the cover of a magazine. She is definitely the only one being sponsored.",
        "It's really profitable to have a pretty face. Although we are better than her at dancing and singing...",
        "(But, I will never be able to see this kind of stage again... Because Haruka-chan has retired...)",
        "When you see it from above the stage, the lightsticks being blue, give you the feeling of seeing the sea. Next to the blue lightsticks, I could see the happy faces of the audience, it was really beautiful.\n\n...Although, I won't be able to see it again.",
        "My time... As an idol! Give it back!",
        "I... am not qualified... to be an idol.",
        "..I still want to do it, but, I don't feel I have the capacity to do it.",
        "Shizuku, you know that. You know why I quit being an idol.",
        "I had a great opportunity and I did my best... I spoke a lot... I studied a lot... I was very happy when I saw that everyone was satisfied with my performance.",
        "...I protested with all my might, but it didn't work. To survive in the industry, the office must always be at the top and it is normal to give priority to the most popular...",
        "I wasn't happy with the outcome, so I transferred. But, the next office at first told me that everything was fine, but then I was put aside again...",
        "After all, I... stopped being considered an idol for the industry. Even for the people who followed me...",
        "Stop it, Shizuku. These are things I already know. I...",
        "What are you supposed to know about it!? You're still growing, you're talented...!",
        "My face is normal, even if I do my best, no one will recognize me... What do you know about me, how can you understand me!?",
        "You are already born to be an idol, you always were from the beginning, everyone has always recognized you as an idol!",
        "I'm Momoi Airi! I'll be your rival, so you better remember me! I really hope you don't think... Huh? Wait, why are you crying?",
        "Ah... I was just... I was so scared...",
        "Before I knew it, a friend gave me the application documents, so I decided to audition... After that, I got the grand prize and then, everyone has high expectations of me. But...",
        "Compared to the other girls, I don't have any experience in dancing or singing, so I could end up holding everyone back...",
        "(... I was able to do my best, because of the words given to me by Airi-chan... But... They've all changed their minds... Airi-chan too... I... I can't take it anymore...)",
        "... That... It's not as nice as it looks... Being an idol is not as nice as it seems...",
        "Shizuku hasn't read any of my messages... She hasn't taken my calls either... It makes sense. I actually said some very cruel things to her.",
        "Not only am I not qualified as an idol... but also as a friend...",
        "But... Nobody needs me as an idol anymore, I should... Should I tell Minori...?",
        "Hey, Minori. I'm going to tell you something strange from now on... Being an idol is not only fun.",
        "There are many things that don't turn out as you expected, even after you debut and become famous.",
        "Even though there are many people, there are many things you can't do...",
        "...I don't know what happened to Momoi-senpai in the past. Besides, I cannot know what kind of pain I will suffer in the future. But...",
        "You know? At the office I belonged to, they told me they were going to sell me as a variety talent.",
        "Even if I changed offices, even if they had a completely different policy, they told me the same thing.",

        "So, was the rumour true that the unit members were jealous of Shizuku's popularity?",

        '"Hm? Nenerobo-chan… Are you not feeling well?"\n\n"…What can you tell from looking at a robot\'s face?"\n\n"But you just kinda seemed sad?"',
        "(…Ever since then, I've been scared of standing on stage. But if this stage goes well, maybe…)",
        "…Eh? The mic cut out? I-I can't control it! Why!?",
        "Nene-chan… You don't need to be so sad. Okay?",
        "Forgetting to charge it… Because of such a simple thing, our show was…!!",
        " I'm sorry…",
        "Nothing will happen even if you apologize!!",
        "…Tsukasa-kun. It's not like Nene meant for this to happen. After we left yesterday, she stayed back and kept practicing.",
        "And I can take some of the blame, too - I didn't check the battery. But next time, we'll be sure to…",
        "Next time? What do you mean, next time!? Then what will happen to today's audience!",
        "You all wanted to make this show today succeed, didn't you!? Hey! Am I wrong!?",
        "…It's all my fault… If I… If I didn't have to use a robot to be in front of people…",
        "…Ah, you're right! Exactly right! It was weird starting from when you started hiding and talking through a robot!",
        "Shy? Can't talk in front of people!? Stop messing around!! There's no way you create the greatest show if you don't face the audience!",
        "Weren't you… a bit too harsh?",
        "There's no way you can create the greatest show if you don't face the audience. That's correct. It's absolutely true. But there's an even simpler thing you fail to see. You can't create the greatest show with just one person.",
        "But you… What do you plan to do, cornering a comrade who is apologizing",
        "It's a shame, but it seems your feelings towards shows are shallow.",
        "…To become a star…? …Ah, I get it now. It's just as it seems. To you, shows are nothing but a tool to get your way with.",
        "I won't come here again.",
        "You can't become a star.",
        "W-what do you mean! I can't become a star!?",
        "…Did you not have fun, Tsukasa-kun?",
        "This… There's no way this was fun!!",
        "…What should I do. Everyone's smiles… disappeared…",
        "…I'm sorry. It was because I invited you. And I should have checked the battery, too.",
        "……No, it was. because of me…",
        "You won't be using it again. I left it there.",
        "You don't need to force yourself to be a part of shows anymore.",
        "Darn it…! Why did this…! …I just wanted to have a show…",
        "The stuffed animal... is crying...?",
        "Sa, ki… Saki? Come to think of it, Saki did have a bunny stuffed animal in the past…",
        "…Big brother. Why am I the only one that can't go to school with everyone else…",
        "I want to play with Icchan and the others at school…",
        "I just wanted to make Saki smile…",
        "The reason I decided to become a star is because I… Saki, too… we both had the biggest smiles on our faces then… But before I knew it, I was obsessed with having a successful show and becoming a star…",
        "…They're all more of a star than me…",
        "(Anyways, I said something terrible to Emu, too. I have to apologize properly…!)",
        "…See, a year ago, I said goodbye to my grandpa.",
        "And then my dad said that the stage was old and there were maintenance fees, so it would be better to destroy it and make a new one.",
        "But I re~ally love my grandpa's stage, and I definitely, definitely wanted it to stay, so I asked him not to destroy it! And then he said if I gather enough of an audience that it'd be profitable by the next break, he'd consider it.",
        "I'm saying bye-bye to the stage today!",
        '…Mhm… But because I was selfish and said "I want to do a show," everyone… lost their smiles…',
        "My grandpa told me that making everyone smile was the most important thing…",
        "…So that's why you'll give up?",
        "…Idiot Emu. You idiot, Emu!",
        "Hey! You want to make everyone smile, right!? So, what are you doing, almost crying! Emu, you're included in the \"everyone\" your grandpa talked about, aren't you!?",
        "…It was my fault, Emu. So won't you… do shows with me again?",
        "(Since I don't have the courage to stand on stage, I hide around and make Nenerobo do all the work… and then ruin everything again…)",
        "…I'm sorry that I can't let you stand on stage again…",
        "No… I get it. I said terrible things to you. I guess you don't want to see me…",
        "You're fine where you are. But please, listen to what I have to say. …Yesterday, I was at fault.",
        "It's true that I was frustrated when our show didn't succeed. But… Nene, you were even more frustrated, weren't you. I was all about myself… and I wasn't thinking about how you… No, I wasn't thinking about how everyone felt. I'm really sorry.",
        "(I can't say my next line…! What should I do, what should I do, what should I do…!)",
        "…Everyone worked their hardest and practiced, but because of me, everything was ruined.",
        "Ever since then, when I stand in front of people, I start shaking and I can't speak right.",
        "People who challenge themselves will make mistakes. But because they keep on going, they can get closer to having the best show.",
        "That's why I… Shouldn't have attacked my comrades who had the courage to challenge themselves.",
        "You can't do shows by yourself… Rui said something like that, huh…",
        "Ah. But afterwards, I lost my temper, and couldn't speak with him properly…",
        "And they all lived happily ever after—…Is what I would like to say, but this story continues.",
        "At first, the alchemist was ecstatic that he could create a show with the townspeople. However… Every time the alchemist put forth a new idea, the townspeople grew exasperated with him and his crazy ideas, and one by one, went away.",
        "…Neither is at fault here. It is just different ways of thinking.",
        "But it is told that eventually, all of the townspeople left the alchemist.",
        "I'll wrap up for today. There wasn't anyone who stopped to watch it anyways.",
        "…Hey, Rui. Don't you actually want to do shows with others again?",
        "About yesterday? Then there's nothing to speak about. Anyways…",
        "Rui. About yesterday… I'm sorry.",
        "My head got full with how the show failed, and I lost sight of what was most important. It's just as you said, Rui - you need comrades to create the best show! What I did was wrong! I don't think you'll forgive me that easily. But with you, Rui, I still want to…!",
        "I'm sorry, but I don't think that really matters to me. It's between you and Nene, after all. If Nene forgives you, then it's fine. But… You and me, we're incompatible.",
        "You want to put on the best show so you can become a star, don't you? I just want to put on the best show. You and me, our values are just different.",
        "I'm grateful to you for giving Nene the opportunity to want to stand on stage again. But I don't want to do shows with you anymore.",
        "But if I chase him… what am I supposed to say…?",
        "What is that. There's no way we can do something like that, are you stupid? Be serious.",
        "Aren't you just having fun with making us go through dangerous situations?",
        "…I can't keep up with you anymore…",
        "So all of you decided to ambush me? I'm sorry, but you can't change what I think.",
        "It doesn't matter what you show me. I told you. I'm not going to do shows with you…",
        "As the leader lost his temper, he stole the smiles away from everyone else… And the troupe disbanded.",
        "But when the leader was by himself, suddenly, he started to feel very lonely. Even though it was so much fun when he was doing the show…",
        "The leader remembered what it was like when he first started to do shows, and reflected upon his attacking of his comrades.",
        "For Mom, who was always sickly… Dad had written a song as a present, within that music box.",
        "\"One day, I'd like to write songs as kind as Dad's,\" was what I thought. But…",
        "Dad… could no longer write his songs.\n\nBecause of me—he couldn't write them anymore.",
        "…Dad... My songs gave you nothing but pain, and anguish… I… I…",
        "I… I stole music away from you, Dad...",
        "Because my songs weren't songs that brought anyone happiness… Dad, you…",
        "I, I have to write songs that bring happiness to people.",
        "I have to write a song… that can save anyone, no matter who.",
        "… I have to write it… I have to… I have to… continue writing…",
        "No, not this. It's not this kind of sound…",
        "I have to keep on writing songs, I have to continue... ",
        "If I can't write a song that'll make anyone happy, I'll…",
        "This world… that girl's memories, they made this uninhabited, empty Sekai.",
        "I am here… in order to help that girl find and see her true feelings, in this place.",
        "But, in the condition of this Sekai… that girl cannot find them. In this empty Sekai...",
        "That's why, Kanade… I ask you, please save her.",
        "That's why, I ask you, please save her. By your side, she will soon appear, Kanade. “That girl” will…",
        "…There is no time. Kanade, please, that girl—save her.",
        "Maybe it's a lack of sleep… I'll take a little nap… No, I can't. I have to keep writing. I can't stop now.",
        "I'll create a song… A song… that can save somebody, anybody.",
        "It's like I'm being stabbed right at the heart, or my emotions got gouged out… ",
        "No… This isn't going to work. This part could use a more shaper, quicker sound…",
        "… The way I drew this… It's not going to cut it.",
        "I don't really like the color of the shadows… Maybe if I made them bluer. But if I keep painting over this…",
        "Agh… Today's a bust. I can't draw properly at all.",
        "My art account's barely getting any followers, huh.",
        "(If my songs could save anyone… And their close ones as well…)",
        "…Dad... If I don't create it, the \"song that'll save anyone\"...",
        "Hurry, come…",
        '"Hurry, come"... What did that mean?',
        "But, unlike K's songs… OWN's songs are just… cold to the touch.",
        "K's songs, you know, no matter how dark, how painful the air of the song gets… there's always something hopeful in it.\n\nOWN… doesn't have anything like that at all. No matter where you look… it's all dark. There's an intense feeling of rejection all over.",
        "That sharp, jagged, knife-like feeling is cool as hell. Someone who could make songs like this… I wonder what kind of person could do that…?",
        "…! This song… It's like they're desperately crying out…",
        "They're hurting, and can't get out of it… A lonesome despair. That's what it feels like, this song…",
        "Hey. Yuki. This song. You made it… didn't you.",
        "This song.. It's really similar to one you made before.",
        "And, when I first heard your music. I was really impressed. At that time, I…\n\nI felt like… your song saved me.",
        "I see... My song was able to save someone. Even just a little… I'm glad.",
        "…Saved? What am I… talking about.",
        "When I listen to OWN's songs, I feel like I'm being… dragged down under.",
        "Listening to it makes me want to disappear here and now. It's weird though… because I keep listening to it anyway…",
        "…How pointless. I keep writing these songs, yet I can't find it. If I can't find it, I'll…",
        "Now that you mention it! Mafuyu always listens to our requests, but she never talks about what she wants to do.",
        "I see, I'm glad. But… Since you have so many friends, are you telling them whenever they're bothering you?",
        "Isn't it better to be with students who can compete with you, rather than those you have to teach all the time? You can learn a lot from being around them. Make sure not to waste your time on mindless things, okay?",
        "Don't you dislike being told to be picky with your friends?",
        "Rather than hearing you out and what you think… being told that “this is how it's supposed to be”...I think I'd feel bothered, if I was you.",
        "…How annoying.",
        "…What I want to do? Do I have something like that? …I don't know.",
        "...Miku. I… want to stay in the Sekai forever.",
        "(Chilling, razor-sharp, and heavy… It's just like Enanan said. A song where one is hurting, all alone…)",
        "…How are you? Dad…He's asleep, huh…",
        "A couple of his memories came back to him yesterday. He also talked a little about you, Kanade-chan.",
        "…It's been a week since Yuki logged in.",
        "Yuki doesn't talk about herself often…",
        "...We've been walking for quite a long time… There's nothing, and there's no one here…",
        "Please, find that girl.",
        "That girl… it isn't good to leave her like this. If we don't find her true feelings, that girl will…",
        "Find that girl, and save her.",
        "Find that girl, and save her…?",
        "...Be quiet.",
        "Don't come to this Sekai. Leave me alone.",
        '...What. What do you mean? "Leave me alone"... you don\'t want to come back?',
        "...You heard what I said. I want to be alone.",
        '"Uh, then, you don\'t want to… create songs with us anymore?"\n\n"Yes. Don\'t make me say it again."',
        "Then, Yuki. You want to keep creating songs all alone here… as OWN?",
        "...I don't have any. But I just know. The songs you made in 25ji have a completely different feeling, but there's no mistaking it…",
        "Wh…  Don't mess around! Watching me go whoa, amazing! while knowing nothing, what did you feel!? Did you think I was an idiot!?",
        "...I don't need to be in 25ji anymore... Even in 25ji… it wasn't enough.",
        "When I first listened to K's song… Even if just a little, I felt like I was saved.  That's why I stayed by K's side. I thought I could find it.  But, even that wasn't enough. I couldn't find it.",
        "It couldn't… actually save you…",
        "Because I couldn't find it with K… I thought I'd just find it myself.",
        "...Miku. I've had enough of talking to these people. Get them out of here.",
        "...Can you… truly find it yourself?",
        "Miku, if you and I can't find it still… Let's just throw everything away in order to find it.",
        "To me, that's… all I have left. If I can't find it, I'll just have to… disappear.",
        "Come on… What the hell have you been saying this whole time!? Being saved, having to disappear… is this all just stupid bullshit from you!?",
        "...Yeah. Let's talk it out one more time. Yuki, you're acting a bit weird, too…",
        "Weird? If I'm acting weird… aren't the lot of you the same?",
        "Besides, the truth is—K, Enanan, Amia… You all want to disappear more than anyone else in the world.",
        "Why do you all talk like I'm the only weird one here?",
        "...R-Really, what's wrong, Yuki? Besides, “You want to disappear?”... What's up with that? I think every day is full of fun~, really…",
        "...Stop it. You don't have to keep pretending.",
        "Amia. “I'm having fun every day!”... You keep saying that. But you know exactly what I mean, don't you?",
        "Anyways… I've gotten tired of this. Miku… Again. I don't need these people in this Sekai.",
        "...Goodbye. But… please. That girl… Mafuyu…",
        "...Seriously, what the hell was that? That Yuki… Making songs all by herself as OWN… Is she making a fool of us over here…!? When I was praising her that much… I looked like a damn idiot!",
        "As expected, you can't really know someone's true nature just communicating with them online. Ahaha~",
        "...This isn't anything to laugh about, though.",
        "Although… What should we do from now? Judging from earlier, it seems like Yuki doesn't wanna come back, though…",
        "It wasn't enough… huh…",
        "We don't need to talk about that person anymore. Besides, didn't she say she really wanted to be alone? Then don't come back!",
        "Yuki… even alone, she's still creating works…",
        "...No reason. There was no motive for me to say it then, so I didn't.",
        "I've got no want for talking about my matters outside my being Yuki, after all.",
        "...Just because you have all the talent to write a song like that… You don't care about someone mediocre, huh?",
        "You got 200K views all just by yourself… Are you saying because of that, you don't need us anymore?",
        "You were… just making a fool of me… My… My art… The truth is, you didn't care at all!",
        "I'll draw… I'll keep drawing... I'll keep going! Making a fool of me… I'll definitely show you!",
        "...It's no use. The perspective's all over the place, and the sketch is a complete mess. I… can't draw a good piece at all. No… Not like this… It's all wrong…!",
        "Hold on… Just because you're my dad, you think it's fine to come inside all of a sudden!?",
        "Does a prodigal painter like you have a problem with his talentless daughter drawing pathetic art?",
        "All and every single one of you talented people… All of you are just making a fool of me!",
        "I… Quit making fun of me!",
        "Oi, Ena, what the hell are you doing, making this much of a ruckus in the middle of the night… Is it Dad again?",
        "Shut up! Akito, you have nothing to do with this! Get out!",
        "...I have to keep drawing. Draw, draw, if I keep drawing, even I could… Even someone like me… like me…!",
        "I… I am… can I… Can I really draw something… that incredible? I...",
        "...I've had enough… Why do I… I still have to draw… I have to draw, and yet... Why did it… Become like this…",
        "...Yeah. She's right. I… I just want to disappear. Why do… you know that…?",
        "\"...That one over there, aren't they the one from the rumors? This is the first time I've ever seen them this close.\"\n\n\"Me too. Surprised me for a second there. If I didn't know better I probably wouldn't have realized.\"",

        "I'm not something for display,  though.",
        "We don't really need anything but we're curious about something. Why are you dressed like that?",
        "Ahaha, I'm already used to it. Even though it has nothing to do with them... Those kind of humans are so annoying, aren't they?",
        '"By the way, If Mizuki hates being told all sort of things about them, they should at least dress normally to school."\n\n"I think so too. If you\'re different from the others, everyone would naturally get curious..."',
        "I get you. How should I put this, like they can't blend in with everyone else.",
        "If that's how you think, you shouldn't have said things that make it seem like you understand...",
        "...This is so stupid. I just want to be myself, though.",
        "Liar, didn't you have it hard too?",
        "...No. This sound… it won't do. This song… isn't enough.",
        "I couldn't… save anyone.",
        "We've got no time for that. I have to keep making songs. More, more songs…",
        "Don't get in my way.",
        "This… She isn't willing to hear us out anymore, huh… It'll be pretty difficult to talk like this. Let's just leave her for now.",
        "(This won't do. The guitar's too slow and loose. But, I need to keep the sense of subtlety... Huh? What? I'm just sitting down, yet… I feel light-headed…",
        "...Right. I haven't eaten anything since yesterday… But… Having time to eat is…",
        "Unable to reach out to the light, stuck in a dark, deep sea… This sound…",
        "...In the end, I just wanted to know if she did feel saved.",
        "Selfishly… I thought, if Yuki felt like she'd been saved by my songs… Then maybe, I'd also feel like I'd been saved…",
        "...No. I think that's wrong, though. Still… I have to keep going. If I don't make a song that can save someone, I'll… I...",
        "But… The truth is… going on with making songs, is there still… a point?",
        "Dad... I can't… continue making songs like this…",
        "...It's no use! Why can't I think of anything new… At least a little, please…",

        "\"...Dad? You look kinda pale. Don't tell me… you feel unwell?\"\n\n\"...No, I'm good. I'm just sleep deprived and a tad bit tired. I'm sure if I lie down, I'll feel better right away.\"\n\n\"Is that so? If that's all it is, then it's okay, but…\"",

        "Your dad stressed himself out too much. Right now, he's in an amnesiac state. Fortunately, neither his mind nor his body was affected. The cause was psychogenic stress—most people get better in a few days just by taking a break. Although…",

        "(I… just want to disappear... Not hungry… at all… If I keep this up… and starve… will I disappear, I wonder…)",
        "...Ah. Mom's music box… It fell on the floor…",
        "...The song… Dad made… It's a kind melody… Mom loved it… And so did I… Dad's songs…",
        "...I have to write it.",
        "Because my songs weren't songs that brought anyone happiness… Dad, you became like that…",
        "I have to continue writing… so that I can make a song that brings happiness to anyone…",
        "A song… that can save anyone…",
        "I have to… I have to write it… I… have to keep writing…",
        "(Dad… I tried so hard… But, my songs… couldn't save anyone.)",
        "(I caused Dad so much pain… And I couldn't save Yuki… Am I allowed to still keep writing songs…?)",
        "Yuki…  So that's why… she was in that place. In that quiet, and cold place… And I was, too. Well… That's enough.",
        "(... There's nothing here... The ground is hard… but it isn't cold. Like this… I'll close my eyes… And just stay here… Will I finally find peace…I wonder…)",
        "(......? I can hear someone… singing…? That's… Miku's voice? And, this song… It's a song I made, back then…?)",
        "Why… do you know of my song?",
        "...My song has been here, from the beginning…?",
        "This Sekai born from that girl's memories was empty, all blank and devoid of color. But… Inside, there was only this song. That's why, I think… Your song had reached the memories of that girl.",
        "But… It couldn't save Yuki! ...My songs… weren't enough…! They reached… but there's no point to that…!",
        "...Kanade, too. You're suffering… the same pain that girl is feeling…",
        "Because your song is the only thing in this empty Sekai… I thought that, both of you felt the same pain.",
        "To that girl, whom nothing could reach towards, it was only your song that could do so—because you felt the same pain, the same feelings.",
        "It wasn't enough… but it was the only thing that could reach her heart.",
        "I… want to find that girl's true feelings.",
        "That girl, in order to find her true self… has been making songs, nonstop.",
        "As she suffered, and ached, and cried, struggling with tears in her eyes…  She still kept on writing.",
        "That girl's true feelings… aren't to disappear.",
        "That's why, please find that girl. The only one who can do that, is you.",
        "My... My songs… They can save Yuki?",
        "The one that'll find her, is my song…",
        "If… that's the case, then…  I… I have to keep writing. This time—I have to save Yuki.",
        "... How annoying. I can't find it after all. I… Where's the real me…?",
        "This… I should be happy about this, yeah…",
        "Come on, Asahina-san can't go, you guys! She's the highest honor student, isn't she? She has club activities to do, regional tournaments to attend, and she's studying really hard too. Being that busy basically means you have no free time for anything, riiiight?",
        "(... Everyone's smiling. If everyone's happy about it, then this is fine, anyhow. Mother, Father, my classmates and my teacher, everyone… If they're happy, then…)",
        "(This cake… doesn't taste like anything. Is it delicious, I wonder. But, Mother said it was, so it's certainly… But, it isn't just the cake. Food from restaurants, Mother's food… I can't taste them at all, lately.)",
        "Maybe… I'm overthinking it. I should do something I like for a change of pace.",
        "Huh? I… what did I… like, again…?",
        "I have an idea. I should listen to that song everyone showed me yesterday. It's a really bright and fun song.\n\n… A fun song… what is that, I wonder…\n\n...I don't know…",
        "What did I like, again… What did I just do…? I… Where, am I…?",
        "I looked, and looked, I made songs, I made them… But I can't find it after all. I've had enough… Miku.",

        "(Well, honestly, I'm not feeling too great myself either. Everyone's been feeling lost this whole time, after all…)",
        "(K, and Enanan too… I'm sure they're feeling a lot…)",
        "...Yuki… she's been hurting this whole time, too.",
        "You see… The day Yuki disappeared, I accidentally listened in to a conversation between her and her mom.",
        "Yuki's mom's the type of person to naturally push her values onto other people. But, Yuki listened to it all without care.",
        "If Yuki was fine with it, then there's no need to poke my nose into it, was what I thought. But… her Sekai turned out to be like that, didn't it?",
        "...No. It's… probably not merely for her mother's sake. She probably changed herself… for the sake of other people around her, too.",
        "That's why, I thought Yuki pushed herself to be a \"good child\",for her mom's sake.",
        "\"I have to become someone who's admired, who never causes trouble for anyone—I have to become everyone's beloved ‘good child'\", was what she was thinking, maybe…",
        "If you had that sort of immense pain, you'd lose track of everything you knew, wouldn't you. Somehow, I kind of feel that... Although, I'm definitely not the kind of good kid Yuki is.",
        "But somehow, I understand her. The pressure of having to meet other people's expectations can be torturous, I know this from experience.",
        "...But, Yuki couldn't have that sort of thinking, huh.",
        "Having that sort of burden all alone… You'd reach your limit.",
        "That's why I think… Yuki became like that because she's in pain. Then, if she'd disappear ‘cause of that… I'd feel a little lonely.",
        "...What is… this song. It's even worse than before…",
        "This is pretty bad. I can't put it into words, but this is already…",
        "I want to make songs for Yuki's sake. I… want to save her.",
        "The truth is, she really doesn't want to disappear… huh.",
        "Of course, there's nothing I can really do, and only Yuki really knows what's going on inside her own head… But, I think telling her what I feel would be good, too… Because, if Yuki wouldn't be around anymore, I'd feel really lonely.",
        "K, Amia, aren't you two way too concerned over Yuki? Aren't all of us just tired too? Yuki isn't special…",
        "It's only her being in that weird Sekai place or something that might make her a little different, though. But, because of that, going there for only Yuki's sake… That's not what I think. …That's why I'm not going.",
        "(I have to hurry and write… Before Yuki disappears.)",
        "Faster… A song that will reach Yuki...",
        "(... But… What if I'm making the same mistake? The song I made for Dad… drove him up the wall.)",
        "(If I made this song purely for Yuki's sake… Maybe I might drive her too much into a corner… My song… will send someone into despair again…)",
        "(That song may not actually have the power to save anyone.)",
        '"Thing is, we were talking about this really interesting video… Here, look, this part is sooo…"\n\n"Is sooo boring. You\'re right."\n\n"…Eh?"\n\n"Ah… That\'s wrong, I…"',
        "In the end, I didn't find anything at all.",
        "I knew, from the beginning… My true feelings. I simply want to disappear",
        "Thank god I finally confirmed it within myself. With this, everything will be fine. That's why… you can give it a rest.",
        "...Whatever. If you want to disappear, then do it, fine, do what you want.",
        "OWN's songs really are amazing, huh…  Cold, uncertain, rejecting everything…",
        "Yuki… I hated you, but in the end, I loved your songs… I hate you, but… If you disappear, I wouldn't be able to hear them anymore… That's… That's… not fair…",
        "...Why, did you come back here? I said I wanted to be alone here, didn't I?",
        "I don't need that, anymore. You're persistent. Miku, get them out of here.",
        "...Shut up! I want to disappear all by myself! Leave me alone! This thing… I don't need it!",
        "...Get out. Even though you people don't know anything about me… Don't just come in here when you want!",
        "Yuki, you said it, didn't you… That all of us actually want to disappear, too. You're right. I… want to disappear too, and there's not much I can do about it.",
        "My own song… caused sadness to someone who's most important to me.",
        "I have a dad, who worked in the music business. Dad's own music brought happiness to a lot of people. He always did his best on it. I wanted to become like Dad, so I started writing my own songs. But… My song drove him into a corner.",
        "Yes. Dad was hurting the entire time. His own songs were called old, ancient, unacceptable. Not noticing that at all—I made him listen to my song. I made him, Dad, who was forcing a smile.",
        '… It drove him up the wall even more. "I can\'t ever make a song like this…" was what he thought.',
        "Dad fell into despair… and finally lost consciousness. He couldn't write songs anymore.",
        "...It is my fault. I caused my father pain, I stole music, his most beloved thing, from him—and I stole his future, too. That's why—I just… can't help it, I want to disappear…",
        "But, Dad told me, to keep writing songs… That's why, I… I have to keep writing songs, so I could create one that saved someone, was what I thought… So, I kept living on.",
        "A song that can save anyone no matter how much despair they're in… I have to keep on writing, to create that song, regardless of how much I want to disappear.",
        "K, you're cursed by your father, huh.",
        "You're plagued by an unfading curse… Poor you.\n\nBut your curse is nothing to me. Don't drag me into that.",
        "K, you want to save yourself, and to do that you have to save me—that's all there is to it. You're just desperate… uselessly struggling.",
        "...That's not the only pain we share, though. Because, K, really… You want to disappear.",
        "You want to save me, even if it's a curse?",
        "But, even if I listen to that song, nothing would change. It will save me a little… But then I'll just want to disappear again.",
        "That's why it's enough. Leave me alone.",
        "I have something to say to her, to Yuki. Because I really, really can't stand her saying some bullshit like “I can't find myself” or “It's better for me to disappear”!",
        "What is wrong with you? How can you say things like wanting to disappear so casually when you have something that I want?",
        "..What are you talking about? I don't have anything. It's always been like that.",
        "…You don't have anything? To me it isn't like that! I've said it already!",
        "You're so talented it makes me angry!",
        "You have something! You can make such amazing works! You even have a lot of people waiting and looking forward to your works! You have something that I… That I'm dying to have…",
        "I can't get your songs out of my head! Even though I really hate selfish people like you, I still want… I still want to listen to your songs!!",
        "Even though I hate you, even though I hate you…! Somewhere inside my heart, I don't want you to disappear… I want to listen to your songs more and more…!",
        "That's why… Don't disappear… You have to make more songs…!",
        "If you have talents, you have to suffer as much as the people who don't have it and make songs!!",
        "If you disappear… I won't ever forgive you!!",
        "…I don't care whether my songs are great or whatever.",
        "What I want isn't that. It's also not anybody's praise or admiration. I just—wanted to find it.",
        "But, I understood that it's impossible, so I don't care anymore. You probably don't understand either.",
        "See, be it someone genius, rich, or someone cute, there would still be things that trouble them, right?",
        "No matter how many amazing songs she puts out, If she can't get what she wants most, I think it's meaningless to her~",
        "That's why, I think if she wants to disappear then she can do as she likes. Cause even if we say all kinds of things to her, in the end only she understands her own problems.",
        "…But well, somehow, I felt like we're similar in a way. Like the part where it seems like the people around us are changing our actual self little by little. We resist it, accept it",
        "Like that, we get tired as we're desperate, And everything just doesn't matter anymore… I think we share those feelings to some extent.",
        "There aren't that many people around that understand this feeling, you know.",
        "That's why… I just think that it's lonely if Yuki were to disappear.",
        "All of you are just doing things as you like…\nSelfishly getting jealous of me,\nSelfishly empathizing with me,\nSelfishly trying to save me…",
        "Please stop… Isn't it enough already?",
        "I want to disappear. That is my true feeling.",
        "I'm tired already…! I'm tired… of thinking that there might still be hope, that I might still find it.",
        "If that's the case, then it would've been easier for me to think that I won't find it from the beginning.",
        "That's why, I… I…! I don't want to think that I might be saved anymore!",
        "I'm tired already!!",
        "No matter, no matter, no matter how much I look for it!! I can't find it…",
        "Then I'd look for it again, then I'd think “this isn't it,” and then I'd fall into despair…",
        "I can't take anymore of this…!!!",
        "I will keep making songs. Even if it's a curse that dad put on me—",
        "I don't want anyone to disappear right in front of my eyes ever again.",
        "But… But…! Didn't you want to disappear too!?",
        "That's why, if I fall into despair, and if it looks like I'm about to disappear… Just say “I still haven't found it”.",
        "…Do you understand what you're saying? That's just like adding another curse on top of an existing one!",
        "Until I can find myself, you have to keep making songs! This…!",
        "Why are you… going that far…",
        "That's—just my ego and nothing more.",
        "…I don't know. I don't know how much time it'd take until I can find it. It might be all over before I can find it.\n\nEven so… Are you really going to do it?",
        "Haha. To become that desperate… How stupid… Haha… Hahaha.",
        "...Can you tell me, next time? My sound… what kind of sound it is.",
        "…Hey, Dad, something great happened. I met a girl who, if even just a little, was like me. And for her sake, I wrote a song… She wasn't able to listen to that song… But, in exchange, that girl was able to find her most precious thing. Her real feelings—and her real song.",
        "My songs… haven't been able to save anyone yet, but… But, I'll keep writing... That's why, Dad, I want you to listen to it too, one day.",
        "If I were a senior, calm, reliable, help out when there's trouble... Is it like Luka?",
        "(Being a senior, It might take a bit more time)",
        "Ah. Yet… Ichika and Saki will be sure to come again, but what should I do about Shiho and Honami?",
        "Then Honami's… It sounds like she's scared of something.",
        "Oh, so-sorry Miku! Just felt a bit lonely...",
        "Did you...have an argument with Ichika?",
        "Icchan hasn't been feeling good and it's my fault...",
        "Yeah. It's enough, I don't want to force her to be with me, nor join the band...",
        "Sorry that I disappointed you. Even though I said “I'll never give up”...",
        "You really wanted to be with Honami, but after thinking about it, you chose to prioritize Honami's feelings and not hurt her, right?",
        "It must really hurt for you to not be with Honami.",
        "But, if Honami still doesn't come back...",
        "(Oh no... She won't notice me at all...)",
        "(Huh? I feel like I'm forgetting something... Oh no!)",
        "I'm sorry about today. I forgot to switch positions...",
        "They all left feeling blue...",
        "Yeah… We've never had a fight that lasted this long before, so I don't know what to do...",
        "Well, we both wanted to sing this particular part of our song, and argued over which one of us should sing it...",
        "And when I yelled at Len, he yelled back at me.",
        "That's when I called him a blockhead and started ignoring him, and he started giving me the cold shoulder too… And we've been like that ever since...",
        "But I don't want to stop speaking with him, so I keep thinking that I should apologize, but can never work up the courage to...",
        "Yeah… The whole reason we're fighting now is because I yelled at him first.",
        "But… what would I do if Len and I keep fighting like this and never speak to each other ever again? I don't want that to happen...",
        "I'm happy when I practice a lot and smile with everyone, but ending it makes me sad...",
        "I think it got shocked because Tsukasa himself didn't remember them",
        "All we can do is get Tsukasa to regain his forgotten true feelings.",
        "You might be right. It was pretty depressed the whole time...oh?",
        "Hm? Is that crying...?",
        "Like…? Whether I like it or hate it… I really don't know.",
        "(She's probably been writing all day today.)",
        "(She's been like this ever since she came to this Sekai. Always continuing to write.)",
        "(But… She still can't find her true feelings.)",
        "(What… can I do to help her find them?)",
        "(I keep thinking about it, but nothing comes to mind… What should I do?)",
        "(But… If I only keep thinking about it like this, I feel like I'll never find a solution.)",
        "(I just returned to where I started. What do I do, I couldn't think of anything...)",
        "(But…… She calmed down a little. Seems like there are other things Mafuyu cares about, besides making songs.)",
        "(...This song, I wonder if it's special for her.)",
        "(There is nothing but music sheets surrounding her.)",
        "(The notes on these pages seem full of pain…)",
        "(......Mafuyu's songs, I think she's putting her feelings into them.)",
        "That's… the song I wrote?…It sounded like it wasn't mine.",
        "Other people say my songs are heavy and depressing, but when you sang it… it sounded completely different.",
        "It felt lonely, butーIt still kind of sounded like you wanted somebody to save you.",
        "Wanting to be saved…I think that must've been the feeling you had put into the song...",
        "It sounded warm before.But now I'm not so sure anymore.",
        "(...She's back to writing. Seems like she doesn't hear me anymore.)",
        "...Mafuyu? What happened? You look pale...",
        "I won't… be making songs again...I don't want to do anything.",
        "I still can't find myself, even when I'm creating music as OWN.",
        "I can't find my true self… and how I look for it makes no difference...",
        "That song wasn't enough for me. It couldn't save me…",
        "No, it wasn't just that song. Nothing is enough for me to find myself...",
        "...I used to do that a lot as a child. I feel like it made me think about many different things.",
        "Yes…… For example, what would make my parents happy. Or what I could do to get along with my friends...\n\n...But before I realized it, thinking about all these things made me forget what I really wanted to do, what I liked to do.",
        "So after that, no matter how many times I tried to understand… it was all useless. I just couldn't, no matter what I did. I... just can't find myself.",
        "(I can't do anything other than staying next to her like this... But, definitelyー)",
        "Kanade… Please come soon…...",
        "Yes. It was a really lonely sound before...",
        "Well… This is a song of the current Mafuyu, isn't it?",
        "...It's been raining all the time, lately. This really stinks.",
        "I hope it'll clear up when Tsukasa and the others visit.",
        "...This means I can't see the stars tonight, either...",
        "I wonder how everyone's doing. My classmates are probably all having fun.",
        "...I sure wish I could go see them...",
        "(If I told her how I was dreaming of when I was in the hospital, she'd definitely make a fuss about it)",
        "(I was admitted into a really faraway hospital, and Icchan couldn't visit me much. That must've made her worry a lot)",
        "(Now that I'm all better, I shouldn't make anyone worry anymore)",
        "(That dream had me a bit shaken up, but now I feel alright)",
        "(I may have been lonely back then, but now things are different with everyone here by my side)",
        "(You've been wanting to be with us for such a long time, haven't you?)",
        "...But still... I miss being with the others... I... want to do more stuff with them...",
        "...Saki seems to acting a little differently today.",
        "From the tone of her voice, it somehow sounds like she's pushing herself more than usual. Then things might turn out like they did before...",
        "I can even feel my fever rising a little... Maybe I should cancel going to tomorrow's band practice. But...",
        "If I miss practice like this, we won't be able to go to the observatory together... I just... need to hold out until Saturday... just a little longer...",
        "If you overdo it like last time...",
        "Why didn't you say anything!? Didn't we tell you a ton of times to not overdo it!? Why are you being so reckless!?",
        "Because... I wanted to go to the observatory with you all...",
        "We can't just go anytime we want! I... I haven't been able to go anywhere in such a long time!",
        "...Shiho-chan. I'm sorry I caused so much trouble.",
        "That's not it......nevermind. Anyway, get some rest.",
        "(He took the day off work just to take care of me. I even caused trouble for him...)",

        "...I guess I'm all by myself again.",
        "I think Saki must be feeling more lonely than ever today.",
        "I was just thinking, once I give you this letter, you'll be going back home to everyone. I really wish I could be there to see them, too.",
        "All that time, Saki must have been feeling even more lonely than we thought.",
        "Hospital life was really rough in a lot of ways, but it was pretty fun in a lot of ways, too!",
        "But... there were also times I felt really lonely. ...At those times, I would gaze up at the stars.",
        "Because they remind you of the night you watched them with your friends, right?",
        "(Saki looks kind of sad. Maybe that's why Luka is lending her an ear right now)",
        "When I thought to myself how I'll definitely watch the stars with them again someday, I would do my best in even the most awful medical exams. But even so... there were times when I'd have this terrifying thought...",
        "...How should I put this... I'd feel like... it was all disappearing on me... My time with my friends.",
        'I was having thoughts like, "I should be with my friends in class right now" or "we should be talking late into the night on a school field trip".',
        "I was supposed to be spending that time with my friends. But it was all slipping away from me, and I felt there was nothing I could do about it. It felt like everything important to me was disappearing...",
        "And then I'd think about even the time I've spent together when them up to now could also disappear...",
        "That thought... completely terrified me... That's why... I felt I couldn't let this opportunity disappear, too.",

        "… Nah, it's not that I like it, either. If I liked it… I'd feel something of that sort, wouldn't I? I didn't get that sense at all.",
        "…Besides, I know that Yuki didn't really choose to become like that, jeez.",
        "I know, but I have no idea how to act with her at all… When we were talking to her in the Sekai, I was seriously irritated but I, more or less, still understood who she was…",
        "But, the Yuki now, isn't she… like a robot? Like, no matter how I talk to her it doesn't reach, or something…",
        "(...... Enanan's spot on. I have no idea what Yuki's thinking yet.)",
        "(That's why, I feel like I have to know what Yuki's feeling more thoroughly. If I can't, then I can't write it—the song to save Yuki.)",

        "Today, we all went to a doll exhibit together—and it seemed that I would understand Mafuyu better there, but…",
        "Yeah. And, there was a certain doll there—when Mafuyu saw it, she had a really distraught expression.",

        "(I don't really care anymore. Even becoming a doll… I don't have to do anything, I don't have to think anymore. I don't have to look for the real me anymore. I just have to do as I'm told. With that… Everyone will be pleased and happy, right?)",
        "If I tell you—of what use will that be to you? I can't feel a thing. I've already told you that over and over again. Besides, only I can know what I feelー",
        "…It was a dream where I'd turned into a doll.",
        "That doll exhibit we went to today… I became that… sickening doll. I couldn't move my arms nor my legs.",

        "I don't know. Even though I'm alive and should be feeling alive every day, I don't know what's fun, I don't feel happiness.",
        "It all feels so foreign to me, like it's happening to someone else.",
        "But, I just know something is missing… This feeling… I can't put it into words at all.",

        'At the doll exhibit you said that the marionette was "sickening", right?',
        "Yuki—you pictured yourself as that marionette, didn't you?",
        "Hey, Yuki. Try remembering what you felt when you saw that marionette, and put it into lyrics.",
        "That doll...I… felt sickened by it, that feeling was—",
        "…I don't know. Why… don't I know this. Why am I feeling like this… This again, it's the same feeling as before—...But, maybe…",
        "What I feel, huh… Even if she knew that, she wouldn't really be able to do anything…",
        "Something this unpleasant, painful, and useless… I don't need it.",
        'Feelings of hate, and painful feelings too, those are all important things that you feel. They\'re all "you".',
        "… Huh? There's… a doll here? This is a marionette, too. But, there's no strings on it…?",
        "This girl—has always been in your Sekai. You just never noticed, Mafuyu.",
        "I cut the strings on the marionette, and used it as the string for the game.",
        "Threads, are quite the curious things.",
        "...Since you removed the marionette's strings, it's not really a marionette anymore, is it?",
        "This girl… is free now, isn't she.",
        "...Because, you know, it seems like Yuki's always obediently listening to anything her mother says.",
        "I mean, isn't the marionette a doll that's made to be controlled?",
        'So maybe, that\'s why she thinks both her and the doll are "under control".',
        "… She is a huge idiot, after all. If she hates being bossed around so much, then she should just say so.",
        "I think it's… I don't really know. But… I think… my heart hurts, a little. It hurts, but… compared to the pain I felt when I entered the Sekai—it's much better.",
        "So my lyrics can also be turned into a song like this, huh.",
        "Hey, Yuki. You said before that you couldn't feel happiness nor what's fun, that you didn't know these feelings. But I think that's not true at all.",
        "Perhaps, you just convinced yourself that you can't feel them. That's what I think... After all, you were able to write this kind of lyrics.",
        "Be honest, with what I feel… I don't know if I can do it, but I'll give it a shot.",
        "What I feel… huh. I… can feel things, too. Then… I might be able to find myself like this, huh.",
        "I see... I've forgotten something important.",
        "Forgive me, Tsukasa-kun. The zombie malfunctioned. I thought it would be fine since I equipped the safety device... This is my responsibility.",
        "But you know, things like that happen all the time. I'll be more careful next time. If something bad happens during the show, it will make the audience sad.",

        "It feels like you're not being yourself today.",

        "I'm doing fine by myself… I think it's better that way.",
        "It's because of that incident.",
        "I became afraid that Tsukasa-kun might leave me like my old friends.",
        "The truth is I don't want to lose a place where I can make my ideas come true.",

        "I just... wanted to show it to you at all costs... I couldn't bring everything... But I wanted to show you Ohina-sama and Odairi-sama at least! But... Sorry. I fell down on the way, and they got dirty... Even though they're Saki's precious Hina dolls...",
        "(...Saki is smiling. But...... Because I got the Hina dolls dirty...)",
        "Yeah. Saki's sad face from back then remains deep in my mind even now...",
        "...Why...? Why did you change my Ohina-sama doll to a new one...?",

        "Nope, you forgot about it! If you really remembered, you wouldn't do this! Onii-chan, I noticed you've always been a bit forgetful, but I didn't think you'd forget about this Hina doll too... Onii-chan, you...! You...! You forgetful dummy!",
        "What's so good about this worn and tattered doll anyways?! Your friends will laugh at you for this, you know?!",
        "Whatever! I don't care about you anymore, Onii-chan! I'm done until you remember about that time again!",
        "What does she mean I \"forgot\"...? Am I forgetting something again...? No, that can't be! I remember my frustrations from that day very well, and that's why I...!",

        "He even bought that Hina doll for my sake, but I ended up saying mean things to him...! Uuh... I wonder if Onii-chan will come home today...",
        "We can finally celebrate Hinamatsuri at home now that I'm out of the hospital... But if it's like this, it'll be lonelier than when I was hospitalized...",
        "I'm sure he's so angry he doesn't even want to read my messages. So even if I send that \"I'm sorry\", I'm sure... he still won't read it.",
        "...No, actually, I got into a fight with Saki. This morning, I replaced the old doll with the new one, and Saki told me that she wanted the old one better... While we argued each of our points, it eventually became a fight, and I went to school just like that.",
        "...It's nearly impossible to give everyone a blast if Saki and I were still in a fight. But I want to liven up the party for Saki ...! I want to make this year's Hinamatsuri the best one! That said, If I show up at the party while we're still in a quarrel...",

        "I'm the one at fault, so why would I be angry at you?!",
        "S-Sorry. It's my fault that I made you feel upset... Also, I didn't consider your feelings, and went ahead and replaced the Hina dolls without asking. My prideful actions ended up hurting you...",

        "I guess... As is, I'm a failure of a big brother...",
        "You see, Onii-chan... It's true that I was upset. It's because I thought that you forgot about that day. But that doesn't mean I should've said those mean things... I'm sorry...",
        "I know that I was trying to bring the Hina dolls to the hospital, but fell down, and got the dolls dirty... And when you saw the tattered dolls, you seemed upset. That's all I can remember. And even when you were sad, you forced a smile so I wouldn't worry...",
        "Huh? Force a smile...? I did?",
        "So... When you bought the new dolls, I thought that you'd forgotten about my dolls, and that made me upset.",
        "But... I had a big misunderstanding about it. I'm sorry, Saki...",
        "Back then, I was always holding back a lot of things, so I won't make you guys worry. I couldn't say what I really wanted to say, and covered it up with a smile...So it's understandable that you'd get the wrong idea.",

        "Thank you, Kusanagi-san. I think I've gotten the hang of it... But I feel like there's still something missing.",
        "I'm taking my singing really seriously, so I wonder what it is.",
        "What you're lacking… is probably some confidence.",
        "Yeah. The first time I heard you sing, Hoshino-san, it always felt like you weren't too sure of yourself. Even now, it seems like there's some part of you that doesn't believe in your singing, so your unease really shows.",
        "I don't believe in my singing, huh… I think you might be right…",
        "A few years ago, I messed up my performance in a stageplay… Ever since then, I started to really lack confidence in myself.",
        "At the time, no matter how much I sang, I always felt like something was missing. I probably felt the same thing you're feeling now, Hoshino-san.",
        "(If we were a little bit closer, maybe I could have even been her confidant before things escalated so far... Ah but we only really talk when we are meeting to work on songs in the chat so I guess we don't really have time to get to know each other…)",

        "Those two? I think they're totally different types. Mafuyu's often quiet and clinging to Miku, but Mizuki is tiresome and often puts ribbons on me and tried to play with me. But…. I wonder why? I also keep the feeling they're kind of similar...",
        "If that's the case… I wonder what kind of thoughts they are holding in, behind that smile?",
        "(...Huh? I wonder why…. They look prettier than they did before. It's a big tree, but other than that, it's just a normal cherry blossom tree. In the past, it was more like…)",

        "…I don't care anymore.",
        "We just talked about it and Airi-chan said it was fine. But… To tell you the truth, I don't know if she's really fine…",

        "When I was little, she always cared a lot about me. Before when I felt worried or lonely, she always cared for me… Maybe, before I noticed, I had already become dependent on her. I have never noticed such things until now… somehow I think I'm the more childish one. ",
        "Though suffering from lots of pain, she still always smiles in front of me.",

        "Your message of wanting this to be “a song that can cheer us up when we're feeling unsure” really gets across well. I really want to write lyrics like that too… but…",
        "I also felt like it was kind off. It felt like these lyrics couldn't really express the emotions that Saki put in the song well..",
        "T-Those are no good…! After all, they're too plain… and it's a song we all made together as Leo/need, but it's like I've just put in my own expression into it…",

        "Even though it's the same kind of expression, the impression left behind is totally different. I was wondering why it was like that... but I couldn't understand at all.",
        "The issue is... whether Ichika can properly express what it is she wants to say through her lyrics.",
        "...I don't have experience with writing lyrics as well, so I don't think I can give good advice either. It's frustrating...",
        "Is there really nothing we can do...",
        "...Is there really nothing that we can do after all?",
        "Ah.. Sorry! Actually, we're making an original song, but the girl working on the lyrics is struggling with it and can't really write well right now...",
        "I wanted to be of help in some way, so I listened to lots of songs and looked up methods for writing lyrics but... in the end, it doesn't seem like we've come up with any good advice yet.",
        "Let's see. I'd like to be of help too but... If I don't know what that girl is struggling with and why she doesn't think it's going well, it'd be hard for me to give advice.",
        "And for this kind of thing, no matter what other people may say, if the person themselves still isn't satisfied with what they have, then there'd be no meaning to it.",
        "We've been constantly searching for something that we could do but... We probably just haven't been trusting Ichika-chan with it and waiting for her.",
        "(Phew... Somehow I couldn't get into it... I feel like my voice isn't coming out as easily. As a result, less people are stopping by to listen too.)",
        "(So it's no good trying to sing while I'm worried about something after all.)",
        "...But, it's a shame. Your singing just now didn't have as much power behind it as when I last heard it.",
        "But, the way you are right now... let's see. It's like you're not sure what you want to express, and you're singing while spacing out... am I right?",
        "I couldn't really make lyrics that fit well with the song my friends made...",
        "It's tough. Sometimes the more you want to express an emotion, the harder it can be to put it down in words.",
        "It was especially hard when I first started out writing lyrics. Not being able to figure out which words to express my emotions with, I listened to a bunch of music from other artists, and copied down lyrics that I'd look up...",
        "Ichika-chan, that's probably why you can't write out lyrics that you're satisfied with.",
        "Ichika-chan. When you're writing lyrics, you're thinking that it's important for them to be eloquent and that they can rhyme well, right? At the very least, I personally don't think that kind of stuff is the most important for making lyrics.",
        "So, if less fancy words would make for a more powerful expression of emotion in my music, I would choose that way. It'd be a waste if your listeners couldn't understand what you were trying to express because of fancy wording or phrases after all.",
        "The words I write are too ordinary and plain... With that kind of expression, I don't think I would be able to properly relay the feelings that my friends put into the song to others.",
        "(Up until now, I've put in a lot of effort into trying to make things that would sound cool, or try to make lines rhyme, or write eloquent phrases...)",
        "(So in the end, maybe I wasn't confident in my own words... But, I won't deceive myself this time. I'll try to put my straightforward emotions into these lyrics...)",
        "(I see, I... I was thinking of it like that. Up until now, I wasn't sure about what I wanted to do. I just went through the motions of living. So, for someone like me to write my feelings into words, I was worried that they wouldn't be able to resonate with anyone.)",
        "(If I lock away my feelings because I'm worried that they wouldn't resonate with anyone... then of course they wouldn't be able to go through to anyone.)",
        "If I can't even believe in my own feelings that I want to express to others...",

        "(...I can't really consider it a big success.)",
        "At first, I thought it was the same as always. But just somehow, my mind feels hazy. But it was a little different from the usual. It felt a little… warm. I wonder why I was feeling like this. Why did I feel warm from that song only. Why did I... smile... My head hurts...",
        "...Oh? Mafuyu, what's wrong?",
        "…Did something happen?",
        "….. I just can't figure it out. I've been thinking about why I smiled when I listened to Kanade's song. At that moment, I started to feel warm in my chest. Maybe that's why I smiled. But why did I felt warm, I don't know the reason for that…",
        "Then… Why was I moved by it? I don't feel the same way with other songs, so why was it that by only that song, I started to feel warm?",
        "I see. My head has been feeling heavy since morning, so it was a fever after all… I have to rest my body, but… Why did that song made me smile… I wanna find out soon…",
        "Ugh... The headache won't go away.",

        "It's kinda hard to think properly being here. Where would be a, quiet place… I guess I'll go the Sekai",
        "You in this picture, compared to now are completely different. This her eating her birthday cake at 5 years old, her smile was so wide. That time when she was being a “good girl” feels a little different.",
        'If what they say and what they think are different, it means they have something they want to hide, right? But when I look at their expressions, I somehow start understanding things like, "Are they really thinking this way?" That\'s when things get awkward and relationships fail I guess.',
        'However, the thing is... Some people have a "real self" but can\'t show it well, while others are suffering because they can\'t find their "real self." It would be nice if Mafuyu found her "real self" soon…',

        "...? Is that…Someone's huddled up on the bench over there…! Ma-Mafuyu! Mafuyu, what's wrong?! Are you okay…?! Ah, right. You have a cold….! Are you okay? Do you understand me?",
