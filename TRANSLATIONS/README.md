DO NOT TRANSLATE HERE! https://crowdin.com/project/Sbotga

# Translating
1. Feel free to add local PJSK memes, etc into your translations! As long as they're appropriate (eg. "rankma" for "ranked")
2. ENSURE YOUR TRANSLATIONS ARE ACCURATE.
3. Ensure you DO NOT TRANSLATE placeholders, marked with a {}.
4. Ensure your translations FIT INSIDE CHARACTER LIMITS! See below.
5. TRANSLATE COMMAND NAMES. However, these will not be used (maybe at a later date).
