DO NOT TRANSLATE HERE! I will start a crowdin eventually. DO NOT OPEN A PULL REQUEST TO TRANSLATE!

# Translating
1. Feel free to add local PJSK memes, etc into your translations! As long as they're appropriate (eg. "rankma" for "ranked")
2. ENSURE YOUR TRANSLATIONS ARE ACCURATE.
3. Ensure you DO NOT TRANSLATE placeholders, marked with a {}.
4. Ensure your translations FIT INSIDE CHARACTER LIMITS! See below.
5. Don't translate command names! (this may occur at a LATER date, but don't for now.)

# Character Limits
You can use https://www.charactercountonline.com/ to count.

- Command Names: 32 characters
- Command Descriptions: 100 characters
- Command Describes: 100 characters
